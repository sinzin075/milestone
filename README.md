## ðŸ§  Developer Notes

This project is being developed as part of my personal journey to improve my skills in:

- Backend system design  
- Clean code and layered architecture  
- API development with validation and DTO separation  

I'm sharing this repository publicly not because it's perfect, but because **learning in the open matters**.  
Any feedback, advice, or even a _"your naming convention sucks"_ comment is more than welcome.
